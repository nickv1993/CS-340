To write maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs, I would focus on clear variable naming, modular design, and consistent documentation. For example, in the CRUD Python module from Project One, I organized functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records and made sure each function worked properly. 

As a computer scientist, I break down problems into smaller tasks, such as analyzing requirements and designing database structures that meet them, like I did for Grazioso Salvare’s database. My approach to this project was more structured compared to previous assignments, requiring a deeper understanding of both backend functionality and frontend design for a real client. In the future, I’d use similar strategies like entity-relationship modeling and user-centered design to create responsive, efficient databases for clients.


Computer scientists solve complex problems by developing tools, systems, and applications that make processes more efficient and user-friendly. This work is important because it enables companies to better meet their goals and serve clients effectively. Projects like this dashboard and CRUD module can help companies like Grazioso Salvare by providing a streamlined, centralized way to manage data, leading to more informed decision-making and improved client services.
